## Handover
Please see the Important Links file for the main links that we refer to when contributing to Dream Big.

The main task assigned this trimester was to integrate Deakin SSO into Dream Big's authentication system. See the SSO Dream Big pdf file for all important details to continue the integration.

Two other major projects were assigned to the team which do not require handover, however, may be relevant to 2023 trimester 1 contributions:
1. Seed population for API models for API via db:seed
2. CSV uploads for certain models including users

## What we did
The backend team focused on enhancing the readability of the Dream Big codebase and ensuring all features were working.

- Completed SSO research
- Started SSO implementation
- Fixed broken API's
- Added new API's
    - Missing API's, see section below
- Added frontend services and model file to support API
- Fixed broken seeding population
- Fixed codebase conventions (adding API descriptions etc)
- Enhanced README for how to connect to database
- Added documentation on set up 
- Fixed API return result identifiers

## What we handover
Refer to [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ZrjWKRJQ/dream-big-backend-technical-team)
- SSO implementation (will need to work with frontend and QA team)
